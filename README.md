# Automated lights for an aquarium 
This project implements a contiuous system to illuminate any aquarium with a LED based lighting system. It has been implemented on a Hailea E-15 aquarium but it can be easily customized to fit others.

The idea is to have a continuous system that simulates the sun increasing / decreasing the light received by the plants and the fishes as the day goes. The system controls at the same time two kind of colors (white and a blue) to simulate the Sun and the Moon.

Hailea is a Chinesse company that builds average aquariums. In this case it is a small one that comes already with a manual led system so it makes it easier to modify it.
